<h1>Get a copy to tinker with</h1>
<p>
  This is just an example site showing an how to list your past and future talks which you've listed on <a href="https://noti.st">Notist</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This site is generated by static site generator called <a href="https://11ty.io">Eleventy</a> and serves the content that it finds at a given JSON feed.
</p>

<h3>Give it a try</h3>
<p>
  You can get your own version of this site by just clicking the button below, and then providing a the URL of suitable JSON URL (or leaving it as the default while you explore).
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository={{ pkg.repository.url }}">
    <img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" title="Deploy to Netlify">
  </a>
</p>
<h3>ðŸ‘† Ummm... What will clicking that button do?</h3>
<p>
  Fair question. After clicking the button, <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> will ask for your permission to clone the <a href="{{ pkg.repository.url }}">repo for this site</a> into your own GitHub account, and then create a new site for you in Netlify linked to that repo.
</p>
<p>
  It will also ask for a Notist feed to ingest at build time (get yours from Notist or it will just default to <a href="https://noti.st/philhawksworth.json">this one</a> which is <a href="https://noti.st/philhawksworth">Phil's</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Then it will build and deploy a new site for you, complete with hosting and continuous deployment all configured.
</p>
<p>
  The whole thing should take less than a minute!
